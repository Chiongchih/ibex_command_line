# ibex_command_line
This is built for fresh people (like me) to use ibex. Ibex is a very complicated tool which can benefit you research in multiple ways. As a user of ibex for 3 years, I feel like I'm still a freshman and iggnorant about almost everything. So I build this repository to record essential command line you need to use during your journey in ibex. 
A few ppl I need to say thank you: 
Roden Deng Luo, who always love to share and generous. 
Nagarajan Kathiresan, who helped me a lot of time with patience.
David R. Pugh, who helps me with a lot issues, he is true talent. 
The ibex team, they are the most nice people I have ever met, I love them all.
